    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        I crave this Chicken and Ginger Congee every time I start feeling a bit sick. It is incredibly nourishing, comforting and delicious. It's easy to make - it just requires one pot and some patience while it simmers. 
      </p>
      <p><em>“Once again, my life has been saved by the miracle of congee.”</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>1 cup long grain rice (white or brown) </li>
          <li>8 cups water</li>
          <li>6 chicken thighs (bone-in)</li>
          <li>1 piece of ginger about 1 inch by 1 inch (2.5 cm by 2.5 cm) - peeled and sliced into large pieces</li>
          <li>salt - to taste</li>
          <li>scallions - for garnish</li>


      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
          <li><p>Rinse and drain the rice. Pour the rice into a heavy stock pot (a cast iron pot works great).</p></li>
          <li><p>Add in the water, ginger and chicken thighs.</p></li>
          <li><p>Bring the pot to a boil then immediately turn down the heat. Allow the pot to simmer, covered, for 1-1 ½ hours, or until the rice has absorbed most of the liquid and has started breaking apart. It will take white rice about 1 hour, and brown rice about 1 ½ hours.</p></li>
          <li><p>Remove the chicken thighs into a bowl and allow to cool. When the chicken thighs are cool enough for you to handle, shred the meat and remove the bones.</p></li>
          <li><p>Add the shredded chicken back into the congee and mix well.</p></li>
          <li><p>Add salt, if desired.</p></li>
          <li><p>Serve the congee into individual bowls and garnish with green onions, if desired.</p></li>
      </ol>
